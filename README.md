# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
  
## About me:

<h2> Hello! My name is Melissa, you can call me Mel.</h2>


I'm a student in the IDD Program at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.

    
__I have a background in Business Administration and quite the interest in graphic design.__ 
  
<p> My experience lays in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Adobe Rush for this field. I am still learning about UX and Web development throughout the year.</p>

- Cooking
- Going for walks
- Webcomics
- Animation
- Spending time with friends

**It's nice to meet you all!**
