### About me:

  <p>
<h2> Hello! My name is Mel, I'm a student in the IDD Program here at SAIT</h2>
    
_I used to work in the business field before moving to this field of study. My apologies if I seem intimidating..._

My hobbies include: art, cooking, reading (web)comics, listening to an array of music, hanging out with friends, and going out on walks.

**It's nice to meet you all!**
